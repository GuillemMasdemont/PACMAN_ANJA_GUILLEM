GameState Methods:
 
get_agent_state(agent_index)

Input: agent_index (Integer) - The index of the agent you want information about.
Output: An AgentState object for the specified agent. This object contains details like position, whether it's a Pacman, scared timer, etc. (See AgentState object details below).
get_agent_position(agent_index)

Input: agent_index (Integer) - The agent's index.
Output: A tuple (x, y) representing the agent's current coordinates. Returns None if the agent's position is not observable (e.g., an opponent on their own side).
get_num_agents()

Input: None.
Output: An integer representing the total number of agents in the game (e.g., 4 in a standard 2v2 match).
get_legal_actions(agent_index)

Input: agent_index (Integer) - The index of the agent whose actions you want to check.
Output: A list of strings representing the legal moves for that agent from its current position (e.g., ['North', 'South', 'West', 'Stop']).
Game Mechanics and Progression


generate_successor(agent_index, action)

Input:
agent_index (Integer) - The agent performing the action.
action (String) - The action to be taken (e.g., 'North').
Output: A new GameState object representing the state of the game after the specified action is taken. This is essential for planning and evaluating future moves.
get_score()

Input: None.
Output: An integer representing the current score of your team. A positive score means you are winning, a negative score means you are losing.
is_over()

Input: None.
Output: A boolean (True or False) indicating if the game has ended.
get_time_left()

Input: None.
Output: An integer representing the number of game steps remaining before the time runs out.
Maze and Item Information
get_food()

Input: None.
Output: A Grid object where True values correspond to the locations of food pellets your agent should eat. You can call .as_list() on this grid to get a list of (x, y) coordinates.
get_capsules()

Input: None.
Output: A list of (x, y) tuples representing the locations of the power capsules on the opponent's side.
get_walls()

Input: None.
Output: A Grid object where True values represent wall locations. Useful for pathfinding.
has_food(x, y)

Input: x (Integer), y (Integer) - Coordinates to check.
Output: A boolean (True or False) indicating if a food pellet exists at the given location.
has_wall(x, y)

Input: x (Integer), y (Integer) - Coordinates to check.
Output: A boolean (True or False) indicating if a wall exists at the given location.
The AgentState Object
When you call game_state.get_agent_state(index), you get back an AgentState object, which has its own useful attributes and methods:

get_position()

Input: None.
Output: A tuple (x, y) of the agent's position.
is_pacman

Type: Attribute (Boolean).
Description: True if the agent is currently a Pacman (i.e., on the opponent's side of the board). False otherwise.
scared_timer

Type: Attribute (Integer).
Description: An integer representing how many more steps the agent will remain "scared" (after an opponent eats a power capsule). If it's greater than 0, the agent is vulnerable.
num_carrying

Type: Attribute (Integer).
Description: The number of food pellets the agent is currently carrying.
start

Type: Attribute (AgentState object).
Description: The initial state of the agent at the beginning of the game, which contains its starting position.
configuration

Type: Attribute (Configuration object).
Description: Contains low-level positional and directional data. You can access the agent's direction via agent_state.configuration.direction.




#IDEAS: 

We have previous information about the maze, which we can use in studying in the begging possible strategies
# WHEN PACMAN DIES AND NOBODY IS IN OUR FIELD, WE CAN DOUBLE ATTACK.
